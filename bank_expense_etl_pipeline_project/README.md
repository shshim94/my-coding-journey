## Pipeline Overview

### Step 1: Extract
- Reads raw transaction data from `bank.xlsx`
- Loads categorized user expenses from `expense_data_1.csv`

### Step 2: Transform
- Standardizes dates and formats
- Adds (-) signs to expenses while keeping any income positive (+)
- Matches expenses to transactions by date (Â±1 day) and amount
- Flags matched vs unmatched transactions
- Enriches bank data with category, subcategory, and user notes

### Step 3: Load
- Saves a cleaned, structured output CSV to the `output/` folder
- Output is suitable for further analysis or dashboard integration
